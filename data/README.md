Dataset source and description:
- UCI page and documentation describe attributes and context.
- Two files are included here:
  - `bank-additional-full.csv` (41,188 rows)
  - `bank-additional-names.txt` (attribute names & notes)

**Target:** `y` — whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`).

**Important note from authors:** `duration` strongly affects the target but is only known after a call; include for benchmarking, exclude for realistic predictive modeling.

All rights and credit for the dataset belong to the original authors and sources above.
